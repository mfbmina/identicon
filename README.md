# Identicon

This project is part of [The Complete Elixir and Phoenix Bootcamp!](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-elixir-and-phoenix-bootcamp-and-tutorial).

It generates an Identicon, such as Github does for just joined users.

You can also check the Ruby implementation [here](https://github.com/mfbmina/ruby-identicon).
